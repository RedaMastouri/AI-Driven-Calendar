## 1. Tell Memorify.ai what you need
Connect your work and personal calendars to Memorify.ai and tell it what you want to make time for. All you need to do is express your needs, give a rough idea of when you want it to happen, and Memorify.ai takes care of the tricky Calendar Tetris.


## 2. Memorify.ai keeps your agenda fluid
We know how important it is for you to stay flexible, so Memorify.ai doesn't just fill up your entire calendar and prevent you from being available. Instead, Reclaim will dynamically shift events from Free to Busy as it notices your calendar filling up. 

## 3. Memorify.ai rebalances your week
Your workweek is always changing, but Memorify.ai has your back. When you reprioritize your goals or your schedule changes, Memorify.ai rebalances your entire agenda for you â€” just like a great assistant would. No more late night calendar sessions.

## 4. Memorify.ai keeps you on track
Memorify.ai gives you quick stats on where your time goes each week, and gives you simple workflows for telling Memorify.ai when you didn't get something done or need more time. You can make changes on the fly via Memorify.ai, Slack, Google Calendar, and more!
